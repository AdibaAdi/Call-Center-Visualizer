# Call-Center-Visualizer
The Call Center Visualizer is an innovative project developed through the utilization of Java, HTML, and JavaScript, along with RestAPI integration facilitated by Swagger. This implementation serves as an agent-based modeling system, empowering call center managers to effectively monitor and discern the real-time calling state of their agents, including in-call, offline, and on-hold statuses. My significant contributions to this project predominantly revolved around the Java component and, to a lesser extent, the enhancement of website aesthetics using JavaScript, ensuring a visually appealing experience for our esteemed client. This endeavor was undertaken as part of a collaborative class group effort, and we are proud to highlight that it emerged as the winning project among all other students' submissions.
